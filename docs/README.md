# docs

The purpose of this folder is store markdown files that AI can read to help write code. Once the code is written, the value of this folder drops significantly as it is better for the AI to read the code than docs. As such, any or all of the docs here should no longer be treated as current/accurate. I am leaving them here as artifacts that were used to help generate the code. If you need to use the contents of these docs, you should first make sure they are up-to-date before relying on them.
